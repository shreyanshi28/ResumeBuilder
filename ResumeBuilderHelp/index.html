        <div class = "ans1"> A good resume helps you in a great way to get through an interview or a recruitment process.
          It is through the resume only that one showcases his top skills, qualities and achievements.
            A good resume should quickly grab the recruiters' attention by shouting out :"Hey , I am what you are looking for !"
            A good resume helps the aspiring candidates to connect with the recruiter or hiring manager on a personal level and is a great place to discuss the professional skills that one has acquired and how they relate to the position.
