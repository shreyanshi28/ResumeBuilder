# Resume Builder

Project Description : This project allows user to enter his/her personal details to generate resume in required template. Initially, there is login and register page. The user needs to register only once and can then login. The desired template is to be chosen and then a form is generated. A form that covers all salient features of resume is to be filled by user. The user can then review how data is entered and then submit final details. A pdf is generated which user can save on local disk. 

This project can be run on local server with following requirements. Use pip install or conda install (when using Anaconda Navigator)
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-mysqldb
pip install pdfkit
pip install regex
```
For SQL, install MySQLWorkbench 8.0 CE to create table and view data entered by user. 

If the library pdfkit shows error. Download the .exe file of "wkhtmltopdf" from https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html .
Save the file on defualt path. If you change the location, edit it on code app.py
